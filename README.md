Not sure why the DB was uploaded weird but I included the DB files (models.js, conn.js, index.js). Once the repo is cloned,
you can just move those files into the db directory and it should be fine.

Create, Read, Update and Delete functionality all works. Still tweaking some of the code for Popular School and Top School as
well as the error handling.
